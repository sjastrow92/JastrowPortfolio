      <h1>Who Am I Exactly?</h1>
      
      <p>
      Simply said, A man who is ready to get into the nitty gritty of it all.
      <br></br>
      <br></br>
        Based in Philadelphia, I have a bit of an unconvential approach to where I find myself today. 
        Having orginally studied Sport Management, I had my eyes set on game day experiences and being as close to the glass banging action as possible. 
        After all, I am a life long hockey player. After obtaining a bachelors degree from Temple University I embarked on a journey through several sales jobs. 
        From enterprise software solutions to merchant processing in the healthcare space, I felt that I had reached my whit's end in the 24 hour sales cycle.
        Picture Jack Lemmon's character in the classic film "Glenngarry Glen Ross". So what does a man like me do when faced with the opportunity change things for the better?
        Learn to code of course!
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        In March of 2024 I decided to take on one of my biggest challenges yet, a full stack web developemnt bootcamp that will shove a 2 year education down my throat in 3 months time.
        After many late nights I can say without a doubt that it was the best decision I have ever made. It has always been a goal of mine to turn passion into paper. To love my occupation.
        To showcase talent in a professional space. Coding has opened that door for me.
        <br></br>
        <br></br>
        "But Stephen, tell me more about the hockey!"
        <br></br>
        Of course. Since the age of five I have been in the crease, stopping pucks and crushing dreams. I have been very fortunate to still be playing at the level I do.
        Aside from the weeknight rec league's, I spend my summers traveling across the country playing in cash-prize tournaments with players from the NHL, AHL, and around the world.
